a) Start by compiling the code above, don’t forget to add the “-fopenmp”. Execute
this program with a different number of threads (by setting OMP NUM THREADS).
b) Add the “nowait” clause to the for directive in line 9. Did the output change?
Why?
c) Add a barrier between lines 13 and 14:
#pragma omp barrier
Compare the output with a) and b).
